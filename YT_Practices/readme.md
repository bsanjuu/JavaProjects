# YT_Practices

This repository contains various practice projects and exercises that were completed based on YouTube tutorials and programming challenges. The projects cover a variety of basic Java concepts such as arrays, control statements, loops, and more.

## Projects

### 1. Array_Practices
This project focuses on exercises related to arrays in Java. It includes various operations like array sorting, searching, and manipulating data within arrays.

- **Technologies Used**: Java
- **How to Run**: Compile and run the Java files related to arrays using your preferred IDE or from the command line.

### 2. BuzzFizz
A simple implementation of the FizzBuzz problem, which prints numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, it prints "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz".

- **Technologies Used**: Java
- **How to Run**: Compile and run the `BuzzFizz.java` file.

### 3. HelloWorld
A basic "Hello World" program in Java, designed to demonstrate the simplest Java syntax and how to run a Java application.

- **Technologies Used**: Java
- **How to Run**: Compile and run the `HelloWorld.java` file.

### 4. MortageCalculator
This project demonstrates a simple mortgage calculator that allows the user to input principal, interest rate, and number of payments to calculate monthly mortgage payments.

- **Technologies Used**: Java
- **How to Run**: Compile and run the `MortgageCalculator.java` file to use the mortgage calculation logic.

### 5. Arrays
A set of exercises focusing on arrays, such as reversing arrays, finding the sum, and other basic array operations.

- **Technologies Used**: Java
- **How to Run**: Compile and run the Java files related to arrays using your preferred IDE or from the command line.

### 6. ControlStatements
This project includes various examples and exercises demonstrating control statements like if-else, switch, and ternary operators.

- **Technologies Used**: Java
- **How to Run**: Compile and run the Java files related to control statements.

### 7. LoopingStatements
This project covers the usage of loop constructs in Java like for, while, and do-while loops, with different problem-solving examples.

- **Technologies Used**: Java
- **How to Run**: Compile and run the Java files related to looping statements.
