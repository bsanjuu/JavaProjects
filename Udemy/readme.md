# Java Projects from Udemy

This repository contains Java-based projects developed as part of Udemy courses. The projects cover a variety of topics, including web development, Hibernate, JDBC, Spring Framework, REST APIs, and more. Each project is designed to help reinforce Java programming concepts through practical, hands-on coding exercises.

## Projects

### 1. EcommerceJava
A simple e-commerce web application built with Java, demonstrating core web development concepts such as product management, user authentication, and payment integration.

- **Technologies Used**: Java, Spring, MySQL, HTML, CSS
- **How to Run**: Follow the instructions in the project's README to set up a local server and database for the e-commerce site.

### 2. Hibernate
This project demonstrates how to use Hibernate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database operations in Java, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and object mapping.

- **Technologies Used**: Java, Hibernate, MySQL
- **How to Run**: Set up your database and configure Hibernate settings in the `hibernate.cfg.xml` file. Run the main class to test Hibernate features.

### 3. JDBCCourse
A project designed to teach Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), where you will learn how to interact with databases using JDBC API, perform queries, and handle result sets.

- **Technologies Used**: Java, JDBC, MySQL
- **How to Run**: Configure the database connection in `DBUtil.java` and run the project to practice database operations using JDBC.

### 4. JDBCProject
A simple project to demonstrate JDBC operations such as database connection, statement execution, and result set processing.

- **Technologies Used**: Java, JDBC, MySQL
- **How to Run**: Set up your database and configure the JDBC connection in the project's main class. Run it to interact with the database.

### 5. JobPortal
A job portal application that allows users to search for jobs, submit resumes, and view job listings. It also demonstrates backend logic with a database.

- **Technologies Used**: Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, HTML, CSS
- **How to Run**: Clone the repository, configure the application properties, and run the Spring Boot application to start the job portal.

### 6. RestApi
A REST API project where you learn how to build a RESTful web service with Spring Boot. It handles CRUD operations and JSON data.

- **Technologies Used**: Java, Spring Boot, RESTful API, JSON
- **How to Run**: Run the Spring Boot application and test the API using Postman or a similar tool.

### 7. Servlets
A Java-based project that uses servlets for handling HTTP requests and responses. It demonstrates the use of servlets for simple web applications.

- **Technologies Used**: Java, Servlets, JSP, MySQL
- **How to Run**: Deploy the servlets to a servlet container like Apache Tomcat and access the application via a browser.

### 8. SpringJPAEg
A project demonstrating the use of Spring Data JPA (Java Persistence API) to simplify database interactions with Spring-based applications.

- **Technologies Used**: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, MySQL
- **How to Run**: Set up your database and configure the `application.properties` file. Run the Spring Boot application to interact with the database using JPA.

### 9. SpringRest
A project that demonstrates building a RESTful service with Spring Boot and Spring Web, providing endpoints for CRUD operations.

- **Technologies Used**: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Web, RESTful API
- **How to Run**: Run the Spring Boot application and interact with the RESTful API through Postman or similar tools.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Run the projects**:
    - For Spring Boot-based projects (e.g., SpringRest, SpringJPAEg), use:
      ```bash
      mvn spring-boot:run
      ```
    - For JDBC-based projects (e.g., JDBCCourse, JDBCProject), configure the database connection in the code and run the project.
    - For servlets and web applications, deploy to a servlet container like Apache Tomcat and access it through a browser.
