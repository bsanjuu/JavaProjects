# JavaProjects

Welcome to my collection of Java programming projects. This repository contains a variety of Java projects designed to demonstrate different aspects of Java programming, ranging from simple applications to more advanced projects using frameworks and libraries like Spring, Hibernate, and JDBC.

## Projects

### 1. **AWS Lambda**
This project demonstrates how to create an AWS Lambda function using Java. It includes basic handlers and service classes to handle course-related data.
- **Technologies Used**: Java, AWS Lambda, Spring Boot
- **How to Run**: Deploy it on AWS Lambda and test it with AWS testing tools or API Gateway.

### 2. **Bonafide Generator**
This project generates bonafide certificates, designed as a simple command-line Java application.
- **Technologies Used**: Java
- **How to Run**: Compile and run `BonafideGenerator.java` using your preferred Java IDE or from the command line.

### 3. **Bonafide GUI**
A graphical user interface (GUI) for generating bonafide certificates, built using Java Swing.
- **Technologies Used**: Java Swing
- **How to Run**: Run the `BonafideGUI` class to launch the GUI for certificate generation.

### 4. **Chat Application**
This project is a simple chat application with a user interface, allowing users to chat in real-time.
- **Technologies Used**: Java, Spring Boot, WebSockets
- **How to Run**: Run the application using Spring Boot or build a `.jar` file and run it.

### 5. **Quiz Application**
A Java-based quiz application with both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Technologies Used**: Java, JavaFX
- **How to Run**: Compile and run either the CLI or GUI version of the quiz app.

### 6. **Simple Calculator**
A simple calculator application with a graphical user interface built using Java.
- **Technologies Used**: Java, Swing
- **How to Run**: Compile and run the `SimpleCalculator` class to open the GUI.

### 7. **Weather Application**
A weather application that fetches weather data from a public API and displays it to the user.
- **Technologies Used**: Java, Spring Boot
- **How to Run**: Run the Spring Boot application using `mvn spring-boot:run` or build and execute the `.jar` file.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bsanjuu/JavaProjects/
   ```

2. **Build and run the projects**:
   - Use Maven to build the projects. For example, to build the `WeatherApp` project:
     ```bash
     cd WeatherApp
     mvn clean install
     ```
   - For Spring Boot-based projects (e.g., `WeatherApp`, `ChatApp`), use:
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```

   - For console-based projects (e.g., `BonafideGenerator`), compile and run the `.java` files using your IDE or the command line.
